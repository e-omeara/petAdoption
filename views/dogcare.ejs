            <h2>How to care for your cyber dog!!</h2>
            
            <h3>For a long and fruitful companionship</h3>
            <p>Digital dogs, like their flesh-and-blood counterparts, require love and care to live long, 
                healthy lives. You will want to host them in a nice comfortable server where they have
                 plenty of room to run around and explore. You must play with them daily, and ensure that
                  they have much to keep them entertained. It is recommended to take them on walks to other servers
                   several times per day. Beware that they do not pick up bugs along the way!
                  <br>
                  Digidogs need fresh food and water daily. A high-quality diet of HTML and CSS is critical
                   to keeping your dog healthy. Your dog also needs brushing and washing to ensure their
                   code is clean. It is best to id your pet so that they
                    do not get lost or pirated. Take your dog to IT for regular checkups, be sure to vaccinate them
                     against viruses or other malware.
